# Linters

`stencil-golang` comes with a bunch of linters out of the box for each of the file formats that `stencil-golang` supports/uses.

A list of them is provided below. Note that the linters are defined in [devbase](https://github.com/getoutreach/devbase/blob/main/shell/validate.sh) and not actually in stencil-golang.

* Go: [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint), [lintroller](https://github.com/getoutreach/lintroller)
* Bash: [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck)
* Terraform: [tflint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint)
